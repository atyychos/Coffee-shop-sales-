**Coffee Shop Sales Dashboard – Business Analytics Project**

**Project Overview**
This project analyzes retail sales data from a coffee shop to generate actionable business insights using an interactive dashboard. The primary focus is to understand sales trends, customer behavior, product performance, and store-level variations in order to support data-driven decision-making.
Business Objective
The objective of this project is to analyze coffee shop sales data in order to identify peak sales hours and days, evaluate monthly revenue performance, compare sales across store locations, understand product and category-level contributions, and assess customer spending behavior.

**Key Performance Indicators**
The dashboard tracks the following core metrics:
Total Sales Revenue: $698,812.33
Total Customer Footfall: 149,116
Average Bill per Person: $4.69
Average Orders per Person: 1.44

**Key Insights Summary**
Sales activity is heavily concentrated during morning hours, particularly between 7 AM and 10 AM. Coffee and tea contribute the majority of total revenue, confirming their role as the core product categories. Weekday sales outperform weekend sales, indicating strong demand driven by workday consumption patterns. Best-selling products are primarily classic beverages such as espresso and brewed tea. The relatively low average spend per customer suggests clear opportunities for upselling and bundled offers.

**Project Assets**
The repository includes a dashboard image for quick reference, a detailed business presentation containing in-depth insights and recommendations, and the underlying sales dataset where applicable. The presentation is intended for a stakeholder-style walkthrough, while this README provides a concise project overview.

**Conclusion**
This project illustrates a raw retail sales data that is transformed into clear, decision-oriented insights that support operational efficiency and strategic planning. It reflects a realistic application of business analytics in a retail environment, and business development decision making.
